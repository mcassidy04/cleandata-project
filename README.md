The run_analysis.R in this repository is an R language script intended to be run manually.
The R environment must have the sqldf package installed.

Place the run_analysis.R script in the current working directory in your R environment.

Download the file from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip
Folder 'UCI HAR Dataset' and contents should be extracted from the zip file and placed in the working directory where run_analysis.R was placed in prior step.

In RStudio, open the file and select all lines. 
Click on the Run icon, OR press Ctrl-Enter on the keyboard, OR select Code->Run Lines from menu.
Alternatively, place the cursor on each line in turn and execute using one of the methods mentioned in previous step.

The script can also be run from the R console by entering (source("run_analysis.R"))

Upon successful completion, the current working directory will contain a run_analysis.txt file as described in CodeBook.md
